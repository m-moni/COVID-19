The SARS-CoV and Mers-CoV data (and respective controls) were generated from human lung epithelial cells from RNA extracted 24 hrs post infection. The influenza virus data are human lung epithelial cell transcriptome response to infection with 24 hrs of H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1 influenza virus infection. We used the DESeq2 R Bioconductor package to analyze all these RNA-Seq transcriptomic data and the LIMMA (linear models for microarray data) normalization R Bioconductor package was used to analyze gene expression data sets. An adjusted p-value < 0.05 and the absolute value of log2 fold change (LFC) â‰¥ 1 was regarded as threshold criteria to define significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of interest. We used the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) method to control the false discovery rate and adjust the p-values.
